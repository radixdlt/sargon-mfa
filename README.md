This repo was used to implement fundamental parts of upcoming MFA feature in Sargon in fast way.

- `SignaturesCollector` was successfully [migrated into Sargon in PR #235](https://github.com/radixdlt/sargon/pull/235) ✅

- `KeysCollector` was successfully [migrated into Sargon in PR #254](https://github.com/radixdlt/sargon/pull/254) ✅

This repo is now obsolete. So [look at Sargon](https://github.com/radixdlt/sargon) for Radix Wallet logic (including upcoming MFA feature).
