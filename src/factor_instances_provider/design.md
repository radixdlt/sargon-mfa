For every operation that NEEDED to derive any factor, the cache is ALWAYS completely filled afterwards, for each referenced factor source, meaning that if we securify 100 accounts, with single factor source `F`, then 100 instances are returned to be "used directly" AND the cache contains `CACHE_SIZE` many Factor Instances for every `DerivationTemplate` (account veci, identity veci, account MFA, identity MFA, etc).
