Need to merge two (or more) competing ideas on solutions in
`recovery.rs` and `playground.rs` (potentially also code in `factor_instance_provider`).

Delete the `ScanHook` types?

Resolve competing `NextDerivations`s type and `FactorSourceDerivations` (and potentially something related to cache? Or to factor_instance_provider)?
